# Spam Detection
Spam Detection Web App

**Overview**

This project is a Spam Detection Web Application built using Streamlit and various Machine Learning models to classify messages as Spam or Ham (Not Spam). The models are trained using the mail_data.csv dataset and evaluated based on accuracy, precision, and recall.

**Features:**

- Users can input a message and get a classification as Spam or Ham.

- Multiple models including:

- Logistic Regression

- Random Forest Classifier

- Decision Tree Classifier

- Bagging Classifier

- Na√Øve Bayes Classifier

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

Displays model performance metrics including accuracy, precision, and recall.

**Technologies Used:**

- Python

- Streamlit (for web app UI)

- Scikit-Learn (for machine learning models and evaluation metrics)

- Pandas (for data processing)
- Numpy
